# Rust-Book

I'm attempting to learn Rust, and keeping notes while working through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I'm a full-stack developer, programing for fun and profit for 10ish years now. I primarily work with JavaScript and Python, so I'm coming from dynamic languages and I've never done anything like Rust so this is my n00b perspective.

## Sections

### 1. Getting Started

- Cargo packaging seems good
- Installation and setup are surprisingly easy, compared to something like Python or JavaScript.
- Cargo is actually so good I'm skeptical about it.

### 2. Guessing game

- Variables are set immutable by defualt, but can be mutable with the `mut` keyward. Simliar to `const` and `let` in JavaScript.
- Imports look similar to Python but with double colons (::) instead of periods (.)
  - `use std::io;` vs  import `import os`
  - `use std::io::prelude::*;` vs `import os.prelude`
- String formating is similar to Python, using `{}` to insert values into a string
- `println!` is similar to `console.log` in JavaScript.

### 3. Common Programming Concepts

- variables are immutable by defaults
- `const  style is`ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE`
- "shadowing" is basically assigning a new value to a variable that already exists with old value
